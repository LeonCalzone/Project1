        <h1>The Intrinsic Queer Horror Of The Body </h1>
        <p>
            I originally titled this collection “The Intrinsic Horror Of The Queer Body” but after thinking deeper on this topic, 
            I feel that the that queering the horror beyond the body allows for examining the horror of queer experience to gain
             a greater understanding of the body and the self in general. My collection began with trans theory from scholars like
              Susan Stryker and Eva Hayward who explore the relationship between the “unnatural” transsexual body and the horror, 
              as well as agency, that comes from the act of transition. However, as I continued collecting sources, my research grew to
              encapsulate a much wider scope of works such as the cadaver paintings of Hyman Bloom, relics and reliquaries in Medieval
               Christianity, A scientific article about understanding the self through lichen, and much more.
